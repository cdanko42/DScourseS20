\maketitle \section{5} The dimension is 404x450 \section{6} lambda = 
.0223\\ In-sample RMSE= 0.1915950\\ Out-sample RMSE = .159 \section{7} 
lambda = .11\\ In-sample RMSE= 0.1582139\\ Out-sample RMSE= 0.1469757 
\section{8} alpha = .274\\ lambda = .0538\\ In-sample RMSE= .1859432\\ 
Out-sample= .1531867\\ The result suggest that I should use 
ridge-regression, as the alpha is closer to 0 than 1. \section{9} The 
net model seems to be balanced pretty well between bias and variance. 
The RMSE is between both ridge and lasso, so its bias is between the 
two. The value of the tuning parameter also lies between both 
approaches, so its variance is between the two as well. This is what 
we're looking for when estimating y-hat, so it looks pretty good.\\ A 
simple linear model would not work because there are simply too many 
parameters, many of them mostly irrelevant. If we threw them all in the 
same regression, we'd have an R-squared of 1. This, we need parameters 
that trend many of them towards 0 so we only keep the relevant 
parameters.
