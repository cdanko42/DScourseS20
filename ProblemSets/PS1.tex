\section{About Me}
My interest in Economics is what mostly feeds into my interest in data science. Economics is the driving motivation for conducting empirical research, data science is just a valuable set of tools to improve my research abilities. I'm mostly interested in development economics, international trade, labor economics, and the labor of immigration. These subjects are both academically and personally interesting to me. 

I was most interested in taking this class because I want to develop my professional abilities in research and in other areas. There are a number of tools that I would rather learn now in class structures than try to teach myself later, and learning the tools now gives me a competitive advantage. I would like to put together a predictive model for trade based on certain trade agreements, specifically seeing which components of trade agreements influence more trade. My goals for the class is to pick up the necessary skills, as elucidated above, and I plan to pursue a PhD in Economics after graduation.
